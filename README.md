# Machine Learning Data Analysis Practice using Kaggle

Kaggle.com is an excellent website for beginners in data science to practice EDA and ML techniques on various open source datasets. I have used various datasets to practice and my goal now is to create a dashboards using the **DASH** framework from plotly.

## Dashboard
The DASH app is under development but the relevant plotly graphs for the Kaggle ML survey can be found here
